## Logo section

<hr>

The logo section pattern can be used to showcase a group of related images, such as a group of customer or partner logos.
For best results, ensure that the images have identical dimensions.

In the case of logos, we recommend adjusting scale and position within the bounding box to ensure a well balanced result.
