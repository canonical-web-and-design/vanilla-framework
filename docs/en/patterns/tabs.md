# Tabs

Use tabs when there are multiple categories/views/panes of content, but there is the need to only show one pane at a time.

Donâ€™t use tabs for pagination of content or cases involve viewing content, not navigating between groups of content. Tabs can not be nested
or be mixed with icons or button styles.
