# Strip

The strip pattern provides a full width strip container in which to wrap a row. A strip can have light (`.p-strip--light`) or dark (`.p-strip--dark`) grey background.

A `.p-strip` container should always be the parent of a `.row` (from the [Grid pattern](/en/patterns/grid/)) and never the other way around.
