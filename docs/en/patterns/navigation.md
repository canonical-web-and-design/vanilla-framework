title: Navigation
---

Vanilla includes a simple navigation bar that you can add to the top of your
sites.

The navigation items are collapsed behind a "Menu" link in small screens and
displayed horizontally on larger screens.

Note: You can constrain the width of the navigation to match the
`$grid-max-width` by placing everything inside the header element within a
`.row` wrapper.

Tip: You can change the breakpoint at which the menu changes to a small screen 
menu by adjusting the `$breakpoint-navigation-threshold` in 
`_settings_breakpoints.scss`.
