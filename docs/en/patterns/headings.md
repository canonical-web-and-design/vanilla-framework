# Headings

Heading classes can be added to text elements to give them the same visual appearance as base h1, h2, h3, etc., elements.

Styling for page headings 1-6 are provided to aid content structure.

Heading classes are not tied to elements and can be freely mixed, for example you can apply `p-heading--one` style to an `h3` element if that better suits your document style and tree.
